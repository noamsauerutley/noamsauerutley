#### hi! üëãüèª
My earliest forays into dev-ing the web came thx to the [Neopets HTML Guide](http://www.neopets.com/help/html1.phtml) and a compulsion to crack into places I wasn't supposed to. 

Now I build cool things at [Parallel Markets](https://parallelmarkets.com/) with [Elixir](https://elixir-lang.org), [Graphql](https://graphql.org/), and [React](https://reactjs.org/).

Back when I was first starting to get serious about programming, I was frustated by the lack of JavaScript language algorithm-solving resources, [so I wrote some](https://medium.com/@noamsauerutley). 

I live in ~~Texas~~ ~~Brooklyn~~ Bermuda & use **they/them** pronouns.

If you're an emerging developer (especially if you're underrepresented or coming from non-traditional background), please feel free to email me directly at noamsauerutley@gmail.com with questions or to find a time to chat.\
I dedicate a limited amount of time to online comms, so it may be a bit before I can get back to you. 

Most of my code lives in private repos, but in **{{ ACCOUNT_AGE }}** years on Github, I've pushed **{{ COMMITS }}** commits, submitted **{{ PULL_REQUESTS }}** pull requests, and received **{{ STARS }}** stars to **{{ REPOSITORIES }}** public repos using:\
