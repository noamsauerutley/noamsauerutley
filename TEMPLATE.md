#### hi! üëãüèª
Before I got access to computers, I spent most of my time reading the dictionary and sorting rocks. My interests haven't changed too much since.

First forays into dev-ing the web came thx to the [Neopets HTML Guide](http://www.neopets.com/help/html1.phtml) and a compulsion to crack into places & exploit resources I wasn't supposed to. 

Got a degree in classics / philosophy + art, then spent several years teaching Latin, making coffee, and designing + building floral installations for money.

Now I solve interesting problems in an [Elixir](https://elixir-lang.org)-based stack at [Parallel Markets](https://parallelmarkets.com/).

I live in ~~Texas~~ ~~Brooklyn~~ ~Bermuda~ NYC & use **they/them** pronouns.

When I'm not programming, I play with language, pick locks, practice Wudang quan, and take care of my plants.

If you're an emerging developer, you can email me directly at noamsauerutley@gmail.com.

Most of my code lives in private repos, but in **{{ ACCOUNT_AGE }}** years on Github, I've pushed **{{ COMMITS }}** commits, submitted **{{ PULL_REQUESTS }}** pull requests, and received **{{ STARS }}** stars to **{{ REPOSITORIES }}** public repos using:\
