#### hi! üëãüèª

My first forays into dev-ing the web came thx to the [Neopets HTML Guide](http://www.neopets.com/help/html1.phtml) and a compulsion to crack into places & exploit resources I wasn't supposed to. 

Now I solve interesting problems in an [Elixir](https://elixir-lang.org)-based stack at [Parallel Markets](https://parallelmarkets.com/).

I live in ~~Texas~~ ~~Brooklyn~~ ~Bermuda~ NYC & use **they/them** pronouns.

If you're an emerging developer, you can email me directly at noamsauerutley@gmail.com.

Most of my code lives in private repos, but in **{{ ACCOUNT_AGE }}** years on Github, I've pushed **{{ COMMITS }}** commits, submitted **{{ PULL_REQUESTS }}** pull requests, and received **{{ STARS }}** stars to **{{ REPOSITORIES }}** public repos using:\
