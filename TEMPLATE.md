#### hi! 👋🏻
I first learned how to mess with web pages thx to the [Neopets HTML Guide](http://www.neopets.com/help/html1.phtml), spent my teen years cracking into places I didn't belong (both off & online 🙃), went on to complete [Flatiron School's Software Engineering program](https://flatironschool.com/career-courses/coding-bootcamp), and now build things with <a href="https://elixir-lang.org/"><img alt="elixir" src="https://img.shields.io/badge/Elixir-informational?style=flat&logo=elixir&logoColor=9ba4b4&color=31363e"></a> <a href="https://graphql.org/"><img alt="graphql" src="https://img.shields.io/badge/Graphql-informational?style=flat&logo=graphql&logoColor=9ba4b4&color=31363e"></a> <a href="https://reactjs.org/"><img alt="react" src="https://img.shields.io/badge/React-informational?style=flat&logo=react&logoColor=9ba4b4&color=31363e"></a> at [Parallel Markets](https://parallelmarkets.com/).

I like functional programming, [writing Javascript Solutions to Common Algorithm Challenges](https://medium.com/@noamsauerutley)¹, and collecting hobbies.

In **{{ ACCOUNT_AGE }}** years on Github, I've pushed **{{ COMMITS }}** commits, submitted **{{ PULL_REQUESTS }}** pull requests, and received **{{ STARS }}** stars in **{{ REPOSITORIES }}** public repos² using:

¹ _These posts are from my early learn-to-code days, and now look pretty cringe to me. I have vague aspirations of refactoring them, but it's not at the top of my to-do list. If you read them, IDK why I used `let` so much either._

² _these reflect hobby projects, personal programming, and general puttering only_
