#### hi! üëãüèª
My earliest forays into dev-ing the web came thx to the [Neopets HTML Guide](http://www.neopets.com/help/html1.phtml) and the compulsion to crack into places I wasn't allowed. 

A few years + a niche liberal arts degree later, I got super bored working in floral design and attended [Flatiron School's Software Engineering program](https://flatironschool.com/career-courses/coding-bootcamp). 

Now I build cool things at [Parallel Markets](https://parallelmarkets.com/) with [Elixir](https://elixir-lang.org), [Graphql](https://graphql.org/), and [React](https://reactjs.org/).

When I was just getting started, I was frustated by the lack of algorithm-solving resources in JavaScript, [so I wrote some](https://medium.com/@noamsauerutley). 

I'm currently playing in [Haskell](https://www.haskell.org/), [Ramda](https://ramdajs.com/), and [WASM](https://webassembly.org/).

I live in ~~Texas~~ ~~Brooklyn~~ Bermuda & use they/them pronouns.

If you're an emerging developer (especially y'all who are underrepresented or coming from non-traditional backgrounds in tech), please feel free to email me directly at noamsauerutley@gmail.com if you have any questions or want to chat. 
Also: please know that I dedicate a limited amount of time to online comms, so it may be a bit before I can get back to you.
