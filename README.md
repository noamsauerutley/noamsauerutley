#### hi! üëãüèª
My earliest forays into dev-ing the web came thx to the [Neopets HTML Guide](http://www.neopets.com/help/html1.phtml) and a compulsion to crack into places I wasn't supposed to. 

A few years + a niche liberal arts degree later, I was super bored working as a Director of Floral Design. I still wasn't bored by tinkering around with the web.

I attended [Flatiron School's Software Engineering program](https://flatironschool.com/career-courses/coding-bootcamp), and started to focus on actually building stuff for the web instead of just playing around with it.\
Now I build cool things at [Parallel Markets](https://parallelmarkets.com/) with [Elixir](https://elixir-lang.org), [Graphql](https://graphql.org/), and [React](https://reactjs.org/). I'm not bored at work anymore.

When I was just getting started, my friends and I were frustated by the lack of algorithm-solving resources written in JavaScript, [so I wrote some](https://medium.com/@noamsauerutley). 

I'm currently puttering in [Haskell](https://www.haskell.org/), [Ramda](https://ramdajs.com/), and [WASM](https://webassembly.org/).

I live in ~~Texas~~ ~~Brooklyn~~ Bermuda & use **they/them** pronouns.

If you're an emerging developer (especially if you're underrepresented or coming from non-traditional background for tech), please feel free to email me directly at noamsauerutley@gmail.com with questions or to find a time to chat.\
I dedicate a limited amount of time to online comms, so it may be a bit before I can get back to you.
