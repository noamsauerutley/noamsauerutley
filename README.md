#### hi! 👋🏻
I first began dev-ing the web as a kid thx to the [Neopets HTML Guide](http://www.neopets.com/help/html1.phtml) and a compulsion to crack into places I wasn't allowed. 

A few years + a niche liberal arts degree later, I got super bored working in floral design and attended [Flatiron School's Software Engineering program](https://flatironschool.com/career-courses/coding-bootcamp). 

Now I build cool things with <a href="https://elixir-lang.org/"><img alt="elixir" src="https://img.shields.io/badge/Elixir-informational?style=flat&logo=elixir&logoColor=9ba4b4&color=31363e"></a> <a href="https://graphql.org/"><img alt="graphql" src="https://img.shields.io/badge/Graphql-informational?style=flat&logo=graphql&logoColor=9ba4b4&color=31363e"></a> <a href="https://reactjs.org/"><img alt="react" src="https://img.shields.io/badge/React-informational?style=flat&logo=react&logoColor=9ba4b4&color=31363e"></a> at [Parallel Markets](https://parallelmarkets.com/). I'm no longer bored at work.

I like functional programming, [writing accessible JavaScript Solutions to Algorithm Challenges](https://medium.com/@noamsauerutley)¹, and collecting hobbies.

I live in ~~Texas~~ ~~Brooklyn~~ Bermuda & use they/them pronouns.

If you're an emerging developer (especially underrepped / non-trad-background ppl) feel free to <a href="mailto:noamsauerutley@gmail.com">shoot me an email 📧</a>, but please know that it might be a bit before I get back to you.

¹ _These posts are from my early learn-to-code days, and now look pretty cringe to me. I have vague aspirations of refactoring them, but it's not at the top of my to-do list. If you read them, IDK why I used `let` so much either._

² _these reflect hobby projects, personal programming, and general puttering only_
